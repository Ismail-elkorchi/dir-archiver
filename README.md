# Dir Archiver
Compress a whole directory (including subdirectories) into aÂ zip file, with options to exclude specific files, or directories.

# Installation

```sh
$ npm install dir-archiver
```

# Usage

## API

```javascript
// Require modules.
var DirArchiver = require('dir-archiver');

// Create an array with the files and directories to exclude.
const excludes = ['directory_name', 'file.extension'];

/**
 * Create a dir-archiver object. 
 * @param {string} directoryPath - The path of the folder to archive.
 * @param {string} zipPath - The path of the zip file to create.
 * @param {Boolean} includeBaseDirectory - Includes a base directory at the root of the archive.
 * For example, if the root folder of your project is named "your-project", setting
 * includeBaseDirectory to true will create an archive that includes this base directory.
 * If this option is set to false the archive created will unzip its content to
 * the current directory.
 * @param {array} excludes - A list with the names of the files and folders to exclude.
